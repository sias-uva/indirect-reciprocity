# Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems 2024 (AAMAS2024)

This folder contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures found in our submission to AAMAS 2024 entitled _"Fairness and Cooperation between Independent Reinforcement Learners through Indirect Reciprocity"_.

## Instructions:
Activate and instantiate the repository's Julia environment following the steps from the home README, then run `collect_data.jl`, followed by `plot_figures.jl`.
The former requires a `data` subfolder present in `aamas2024`, and in the latter you can select whether you want the version of the figure from the extended abstract or the poster using a variable.
